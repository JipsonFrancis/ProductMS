# Project Name

Welcome to the **Project Name**! This project is built with [Laravel 11](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x) and [React](https://reactjs.org/). Below are the steps to set up and run this project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **PHP >= 8.1** (for Laravel)
- **Composer** (for managing PHP dependencies)
- **Node.js >= 18.x** (for React)
- **npm or Yarn** (for managing JavaScript dependencies)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

If you do not have any of these installed, please refer to the official documentation to install them:

- [Install PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php)
- [Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git

## Step 1: Navigate to the Project Directory

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd your-project-name
Step 2: Install PHP Dependencies
Once inside the project directory, install the PHP dependencies using Composer:

bash
Copy code
composer install
After that, set up your environment variables:

bash
Copy code
cp .env.example .env
Generate the application key:

bash
Copy code
php artisan key:generate
Set up your database and other environment configurations in the .env file. For example, set the DB_* variables to match your local database settings.

Step 3: Set Up the Database
If you have a database for the project, you can create it using the following command (make sure the database is set in .env):

bash
Copy code
php artisan migrate
If the project requires database seeding, run:

bash
Copy code
php artisan db:seed
Step 4: Install Node.js Dependencies
Now, install the JavaScript dependencies for React using npm:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Alternatively, if you're using Yarn:

bash
Copy code
yarn install
Step 5: Run the Development Servers
Start the Laravel development server:

bash
Copy code
php artisan serve
By default, this will run the server at http://localhost:8000.

Start the Vite development server for React (to handle the frontend assets):

bash
Copy code
npm run dev
