# ProductMS
 Product Management System Description The objective of this project is to build a Product Management System using Laravel 11 for the backend, with Inertia.js, React, and TailwindCSS for the frontend. The system will allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, including secure authentication and audit logging for all product-related changes. The solution will provide a smooth, interactive user experience with a clean, responsive UI.  Key Features and Requirements 1. Authentication System Implement a basic authentication system for user registration and login with validation. Secure password storage using password hashing. Session-based authentication, leveraging Laravel's built-in authentication system (e.g., using Laravel Fortify or Sanctum for API support). Restrict access to the product management dashboard so that only logged-in users can access it. 2. Product Management with CRUD Operations Create: Users can add new products with fields such as name, price, description, and stock quantity. Read: Display a list of products on the dashboard. Update: Users can update the product details, including the name, price, description, and stock quantity. Delete: Allow users to delete products. The front end will be built using Inertia.js and React, providing seamless navigation without full-page reloads. All CRUD operations will be performed via AJAX requests, using Axios or Fetch API to communicate with the Laravel backend. Both client-side validation (React) and server-side validation (Laravel) will be implemented for product fields. 3. Audit Log System Audit Logging: Every creation, update, and deletion of products will be logged to an audit log. The audit log will store: The user ID of the person who made the change. The timestamp of the change. The before and after values for product updates. The audit logs will be stored in a dedicated database table, such as product_audit_logs. On the Product Detail page, display the audit log entries to show who made changes and what the changes were. 4. Frontend Display and Styling The frontend will be styled using TailwindCSS, ensuring a clean, responsive, and modern UI. Key views and components: Login/Register pages with appropriate validation and error handling. Dashboard displaying a list of products with options to edit or delete each product. Product Detail page that shows the product's details along with an audit log of changes made to the product. Forms and Modals for creating and editing products within the dashboard, ensuring smooth interactions without full-page reloads.
